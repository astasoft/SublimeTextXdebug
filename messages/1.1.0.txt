  Enhancement:
   - Display error dialog for connection issues upon debug session start
   - Reformat stack entry output to improve distinction between file/line and function
   - Improve navigation from Stack/Breakpoint view to file by breakpoint/entry
   - Highlight current breakpoint/line by selecting row in file
   - Use current value when editing an existing watch expression

   - Opening of file upon (accidental) multiselection in Breakpoint/Stack view
   - Unable to toggle watch expressions by double click when no connection established
   - Losing focus of active view upon closing debugging windows

  Internal:
   - Enforcing of coding style by running flake8 with TravisCI
